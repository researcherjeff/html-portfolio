<h1>The Best Movies According to Jeff</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
<p>Tobey Maguire is the best spider-man. And Spider-man 2 is the best Spider-man movie out of all of them.</p>
<h3>Four Brothers</h3>
<p>Amazing cast, amazing story.</p>
<h3>Chronicle</h3>
<p>I'm a sucker for any movie that involves powers/time travel and whatnot and Chronicle is one of the handful that I can watch over and over again and I still love it.</p>
